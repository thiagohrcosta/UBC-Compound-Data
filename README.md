## HOW TO CODE: SIMPLE DATA: UNIVERSITY OF BRITISH COLUMBIA (UBCx - Edx)

How To Code: Simple Data, is the first 7 week module from the  [**MICROMASTER - Software Developer** from **University of British Columbia**](https://www.edx.org/course/how-code-simple-data-ubcx-htc1x).

## About this course 

**Course Description**

This course takes a unique approach, focusing on a systematic programming method rather than restricting learners to any one specific programming language. This practical approach will allow you to apply your skills and creativity more widely and to program well in any language.

The course is part of the [**Software Development MicroMasters Program**](https://www.edx.org/micromasters/software-development) and presents a core design method with a focus on numbers, strings, images and lists.

You will learn techniques to:

1. Develop program requirements
2. Produce programs with consistent structure that are easy to modify later
3. Make your programs more reliable by building tests as an integral part of the programming process.
4. This course concludes with the design of a simple interactive game.
5. Learners who enroll in the Verified track will receive staff grading for the course project and increased interaction with the instructor and staff.

What you'll learn:
1. How to represent information as data
2. How to focus each part of your program on a single task
3. How to use examples and tests to clarify what your program should do
4. How to simplify the structure of your program using common patterns
5. Recognize and represent more complicated information

## MODULE 3: How To Design Compound Data

In the third lesson from **module 3B: How to Design Data - Compound Data**, we learn how to use structures when two or more values naturally belong together. 


> (define-struct ball (x y)) <br>
> ;; Ball is (make-ball Number Number) <br>
> ;; interp. a ball at position x, y <br>
> <br>
> (define BALL-1 (make-ball 6 10)) <br>
> <br>
> #; <br>
> (define (fn-for-ball b) <br>
>   (... (ball-x b)     ;Number <br>
>        (ball-y b)))   ;Number <br>
> ;; Template rules used: <br>
> ;;  - compound: 2 fieldsv <br>

When do we need two or more pieces of information we need to use compound data. The simple structure is that:

> (define-struct pos (xy)) <br>

- pos: struct name<br>
- x y: field names<br>

Whe can create some examples for this become more clear, letÂ´s see:

> (define P1 (make-pos 3 6))<br>
> (define P2 (make-pos 2 8))<br>

- P1: become a constant.
- 3 and 6 are the pos-x and pos-y coordinates. 

With that in mind: 

> (pos-x P1) ; produces 3
> (pos-y P2) ; produces 8

### To form a structure definitions

> (define-struct < name1 > ( < name2 > ... ))<br>
> ; Structure "name" where name 1 = pos  and "Field Name" where name2 = x y <br>
> (define-struct pos (x y)) <br>
  
### A Structure definition defines: 

> - Constructor: make - < structure-name ><br>
> - Selector: < structure-name > - < field-name ><br>
> - Predicate: < structure-name > ? <br>
 
(define-struct pos (x y) defines:

> - Constructor: make-pos <br>
> - Selectors: pos-x   pos-y <br>
> - Predicate: pos? <br>
  
 # Problem:
 
 **Question A:**
 
Design a data definition to represent a movie, including title, budget, and year released. To help you to create some examples, find some interesting movie facts below: <br>
- "Titanic" - budget: 200000000 released: 1997<br>
- "Avatar" - budget: 237000000 released: 2009<br>
- "The Avengers" - budget: 220000000 released: 2012<br>

Answer: 

> (define-struct movie (title budget year)) <br>
> ;; movie is (make-movie String Number Number) <br>
> ;; movie is (make-movie String Natural Natural) <br>
> <br>
> ;; interp. movie Title-String, budget-Natural Year-Natural <br>
> <br>
> (define Movie1 (make-movie "Titanic" "200000000" "1997")) <br>
> (define Movie2 (make-movie "Avatar" "237000000" "2009")) <br>
> (define Movie3 (make-movie "The Avengers" "220000000" "2012")) <br>
> <br>
> #; <br>
> (define (fn-for-movie m) <br>
>   (... (movie-title m)    ; produces a string <br>
>        (movie-budget m)   ; produces a Natural number <br>
>        (movie-year m)))   ; produces a Natural number <br>
> <br>
> ;; Template rules used: <br>
> ;; Compound 3 fields. <br>


**Question B**

You have a list of movies you want to watch, but you like to watch your rentals in chronological order. Design a function that consumes two movies and produces the title of the most recently released movie. Note that the rule for templating a function that consumes two compound data parameters is for the template to include all the selectors for both  parameters.

> ;; Movie Movie -> String <br>
> ;; define which given name was release most recently<br>
> <br>
> (check-expect (recent-movie M1 M2) "Avatar")<br>
> (check-expect (recent-movie M3 M2) "The Avengers")<br>
> <br>
> ;; define (recent-movie M1 M2) "")  ;stub <br>
> <br>
> (define (fn-for-movie m1 m2) <br>
>   (... (movie-title m1) <br>
>        (movie-budget m1) <br>
>        (movie-year m1) <br>
>        (movie-title m2) <br>
>        (movie-budget m2) <br>
>        (movie-year m2))) <br>
> <br>
> (define (recent-movie m1 m2) <br>
>   (if (> (movie-year m1) (movie-year m2) <br>
>          (movie-title m1) <br>
>          (movie-title m2)))) <br>
> <br>
